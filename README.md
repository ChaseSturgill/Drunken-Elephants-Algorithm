# Drunken-Elephants-Algorithm
This is the Drunk Elephants Algorithm. Like an elephant, the algorithm never forgets. It utilizes tabu search to keep track of all previous solutions and doesn’t revisit them – the tabu tenure is for the duration of the algorithm. However, the elephants stumbled upon a Marula tree and ate too many of the fermented fruits from the tree. The elephants will occasionally “stumble” and choose a random solution that may not be optimal with probability 1-p. There are also k number of elements accessing solutions and sharing information with each other. This algorithm utilizes hill-climbing best accept, random walk, local beam search, and tabu search to accomplish optimization.
